# Blocky Documentation
## Use
Click a block of the left panel to add id to the editor.
Click 'RUN' to run the main function.

## Functions
Functions are the code that is called when a certain event hapened.
### Addition
To add a function to your project, add a non-blue block (blue blocks are the defalut, other colors mean it uses functions).
### Usage
Click at 'Function: Main' and then choose the one that you just added and the editor will get empty, because the function you selected was blank, you can edit it as if it was the main function, but the button 'RUN' will only run the main function.

## Blocks
### Alert
This block will create a window with text in it. You can edit this text with the 'text' input.
